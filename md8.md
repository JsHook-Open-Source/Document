# Connect to computer

You can use `Visual Studio Code` to push scripts to your phone in real time, or get scripts from your phone to your computer

Download the vscode plugin here: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JsonET.jshook-vscode-extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JsonET.jshook-vscode-extension)

After installation, right-click on the `js` file or use shortcut keys

`Shift+Alt+D`: Push script

`Shift+Alt+C`: Get script

`Shift+Alt+F`: Clear log

`Shift+Alt+G`: View log, automatically refresh

When synchronizing scripts (script name + relative path), just keep it the same as on the phone. When using the plugin, you need to enable the server in the jshook settings. After using the shortcut key, a dialog box for entering the ip will appear, so that the computer and the phone are on the same wifi network.

**Enabling the server can turn off jshook, and you don't need to keep it running in the background**
